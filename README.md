# CareSync

Healthcare management app



Awesome, Roniel. Let’s turn your healthcare startup idea into a \*\*3-Phase Capstone-Ready Project Roadmap\*\* — something \*\*big\*\*, strategic, and still aligned with school.



---



\## 🏥 Healthcare Management App — “CareSync” (Placeholder Name)



\### 🔥 Problem:



Hospitals often struggle to organize and \*\*centralize\*\* patient data.

Patients lose receipts, don’t track payments, and often have no visibility on records.



---



\## 🧭 PHASE 1 — \*Student Capstone-Ready MVP\*



> \*\*Goal:\*\* Build a working app that stores patient info, receipts, balances, and doctor notes.



\### 🔨 Features:



\* Add/edit patient profile

\* Upload/record receipts

\* Track hospital debts/payments

\* Doctor can send digital notes (e.g., prescriptions or follow-ups)

\* Admin view (basic login, see all patient data)



\### 💻 Tech Stack:



\* `Java` — your school’s main language

\* `MySQL` or `PostgreSQL` — relational DB for patient data

\* `JavaFX` or `Spring Boot + Thymeleaf` — for a GUI (or web-based if allowed)



\### 📦 Deliverable:



\* Functional local app

\* Demo database

\* Can be shown as your final project



---



\## 🚀 PHASE 2 — \*Startup Prototype\*



> \*\*Goal:\*\* Make it more scalable, secure, and closer to real usage.



\### 💡 Upgrades:



\* Switch to `Spring Boot (Java)` REST API

\* Use `React` or `Flutter` for frontend

\* Secure login/authentication (JWT or Firebase Auth)

\* Role-based access: Patient, Doctor, Admin

\* PDF Receipt generator



\### 🛠️ Stack:



\* Java (Spring Boot)

\* React / Flutter (cross-platform)

\* PostgreSQL

\* Firebase (auth, storage for receipts/images)



---



\## 🌐 PHASE 3 — \*Full SaaS Vision\*



> \*\*Goal:\*\* Become a product for small clinics/hospitals.



\### 🧠 Features:



\* Multi-clinic support

\* Payment integration (GCash, PayMaya, etc.)

\* Email/SMS reminders for appointments

\* Analytics dashboard for doctors/admin

\* Encrypted medical notes/prescriptions



---



\## 🧠 Business Model (optional but powerful):



\* SaaS: Charge small clinics monthly

\* Free for patients

\* Custom premium plans for big hospitals



---



\## ✅ Next Steps for You (Today – Short-Term)



1\. \*\*Decide the name\*\* — branding is motivational

2\. \*\*Set up a GitHub repo\*\*

3\. \*\*Start designing the database\*\* (patients, receipts, doctors)

4\. Build Phase 1 slowly \*\*alongside your classes\*\*
